# Hospital Management System in Java

Welcome to the **Hospital Management System** project in Java! This repository offers a comprehensive example of building a terminal-based Hospital Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Through this project, you'll gain practical experience in designing and implementing classes to manage hospital operations effectively, while applying core OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism in Java.

## üîç Project Highlights

**`Patient` and `Doctor` Classes**: Manages essential information for both patients and doctors, including methods for adding and retrieving data from the database.  
**Admin-Restricted Doctor Management**: Only administrators have permission to add new doctors, ensuring controlled access to sensitive records.  
**Appointment Booking with Availability Check**: Ensures appointments are booked only if the doctor is available on the selected date, preventing scheduling conflicts.  
**User-Friendly Terminal Interface**: Provides an interactive experience for hospital staff to add patients, view records, and book appointments smoothly.  
**Demonstrates Core OOP Concepts**: Offers real-world applications of encapsulation and modularity, with Java classes tailored for easy management of hospital data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to dive in and enhance your Java skills? This project is perfect for beginners eager to learn practical database integration with JDBC and experienced developers looking to reinforce their OOP knowledge in Java.

### Steps to Begin:

1. **Set up the MySQL Database**:
   - Create a database named `hospital`.
   - Define tables for `patients`, `doctors`, and `appointments` with appropriate fields.

2. **Configure MySQL Connection**:
   - Update the MySQL credentials in the code with your database's username and password.

3. **Compile and Run the Project**:
   - Follow the project‚Äôs interactive prompts to add patients, view records, manage doctors, and book appointments.

This project demonstrates how OOP principles can be applied to create a functional and user-friendly hospital management system. Clone this repository, explore the code, and enhance your Java and database programming skills!
